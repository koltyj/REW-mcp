# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-21)

**Core value:** Claude can autonomously measure, interpret, and guide fixes for room acoustics — turning raw frequency response data into actionable placement and treatment recommendations.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core API + MCP Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Testing Infrastructure) — Ready for planning
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 not started
Last activity: 2026-01-21 — Completed Phase 1 verification (all 4 plans executed)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 1)
Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (Phase 2)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 6.25 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Core API + MCP Validation) | 4 | 25 min | 6.25 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 7m (01-01), 4m (01-02), 7m (01-03), 7m (01-04)
- Trend: Stable (~5-7min per plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Validate foundation before features (Can't build calibration workflow on untested code)
- Two-milestone structure (Clean separation: working server → intelligent assistant)
- REW as measurement engine (Industry standard with API)
- Plain language interpretation (Users need "what's wrong and why" not just graphs)
- **01-01:** Use throw-based error handling instead of null returns for type safety
- **01-01:** Discriminated error codes allow tools to provide context-specific suggestions
- **01-01:** Centralized handleResponseError method ensures consistent error mapping
- **01-02:** Use MSW for HTTP-level mocking instead of function mocks for realistic API testing
- **01-02:** Test error propagation via REWApiError with discriminated codes
- **01-02:** Use encodeREWFloatArray helper for big-endian float encoding in test fixtures
- **01-03:** Use InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair() for MCP client/server testing
- **01-03:** Generate REW text format strings for ingest tool tests (not direct JSON)
- **01-03:** Accept module-level activeClient persistence across tests (design limitation)
- **01-03:** Use MSW with onUnhandledRequest: warn for flexible test isolation
- **01-04:** URL encoding verification for smoothing parameters (1/3 → 1%2F3)
- **01-04:** Test realistic array sizes (4096 points) to match typical REW measurements
- **01-04:** Validate empty response edge case for graceful degradation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1-2 (Foundation):**
- ~~Silent API failures are highest-risk pitfall~~ (RESOLVED in 01-01: typed error handling implemented)
- ~~Zero integration tests in current codebase~~ (RESOLVED in 01-02: API client tests with MSW)
- ~~MCP specification violation from unused capabilities~~ (VERIFIED in 01-03: server does not declare resources/prompts capabilities)

**Phase 4 (Measurement Workflow):**
- Research flag: REW API measurement triggering capability unverified
- Session state persistence mechanism needs design during planning

**Phase 7 (Optimization Guidance):**
- Research flag: Room dimensions input method (elicitation vs. manual)
